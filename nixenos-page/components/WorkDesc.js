              <p className="text-muted text-justify">I specialize in DevOps technologies (specifically Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Python and AWS), but my interests span across other topics: C/C++ kernel-level development and x86 assembly.</p>
              <p className="text-muted">I graduated from V Highschool in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça where I was responsible for school's server room and its IT infrastructure. My responibilities were: maintaining about 100 MS Windows clients in network, setting up samba4 AD/DC domain controller with mobile profiles, migrating and maintaining DNS zone on Bind9 server, maintaining SSH/LAMP stack server with students' accounts and integrating those accounts with schools' website.</p>
              <p className="text-muted">After highschool went into college (Silesian University of Technology) in 2019. There I learned C/C++ programming, basics of X86 assembly, basics of electronics (with greater focus on microprocesors, mostly Z80 and 8086), Linux and network administration, design patterns, basic alghoritms, algebra, physics and general computing theory (Turing machine, semaphores, computers architectures etc.).</p>
              <p className="text-muted">In March of 2020 I stared working in Accenture as a DevOps. There I use Terraform to deploy infrastructure to AWS, Ansible to manage remote hosts, Jenkins and GitHub Actions to create and modify pipelines, Jira and Confluence to track my work and GNU/Linux to write and deploy my code.</p>
